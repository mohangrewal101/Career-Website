    detailedDescription: `Designed and developed a full-stack workout planner web application that leverages AI to generate personalized workout routines based on user inputs. I implemented the backend using FastAPI to handle API requests and managed AI content via K-nearest neighbours algorithm, logicstic regression, and using pandas for transformations. The frontend was built in React with Tailwind CSS to provide a responsive, user-friendly interface, including rotating fitness tips powered by logistic regression models for targeted advice. Deployed the backend and frontend on Render and Vercel respectively, enabling smooth public access and continuous integration with GitHub.`,

I was responsible for designing the parser and converting conditional statements into logical formulas compatible with the Z3 SMT solver, which evaluates path satisfiability. The tool supports variable reassignments and boolean/number conditions and presents a user-friendly UI for uploading code and viewing path results.

    detailedDescription: `Worked in a team of 5 to design and implement a domain-specific language (DSL) aimed at simplifying quiz and form creation for educational use. My primary contribution was defining the DSL grammar using ANTLR4 and implementing the Visitor pattern in TypeScript to traverse parse trees and produce an abstract syntax tree (AST) suitable for evaluation. We iterated the DSL design through user studies to improve usability and incorporated conditional logic to make dynamic forms possible. This project bridged language theory, which is allowing us to create our own specific languages, with practical form-building applications.`,
